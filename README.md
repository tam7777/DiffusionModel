# Generating Dermatological Images using Diffusion Transformer

This repository contains the code and data for the project on generating synthetic dermatological images using Diffusion Transformer (DiT). The goal is to enhance medical image datasets and improve AI model training in dermatology. This work builds on Diffusion Transformers to create high-quality synthetic images for both standardized datasets and in-the-wild dermatological conditions.

## Introduction

In this project, we leverage **Diffusion Transformers (DiT)** to generate synthetic dermatological images. Traditional models are often hindered by biased datasets and limited image diversity. DiT helps address these challenges, especially by generating images for underrepresented categories in dermatological datasets.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
